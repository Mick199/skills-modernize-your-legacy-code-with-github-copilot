## User Story
**As a** student  
**I want to** set up balance alerts  
**So that** I'm notified when my balance falls below a certain amount  

## Epic
Enhanced Account Features

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given I am in account settings
- [ ] When I set a minimum balance threshold
- [ ] Then the system warns me when my balance approaches this limit
- [ ] And prevents transactions that would exceed the threshold if desired

## Priority
Medium

## Current Implementation
‚ùå Not implemented

## Technical Notes
- Requires user preferences/settings storage
- Need notification system design
- Implement threshold checking logic
- Consider different types of alerts (warning vs blocking)
- May need email/SMS notification capability
```
